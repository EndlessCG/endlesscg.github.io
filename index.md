# Hi!
My name is Yicheng Gao (高翌诚). I'm currently a 4th-year undergraduate student at University of Science and Technology Beijing. My major is Computer Science and Technology. I'll begin my master's study at the Department of Computer Science, Yale University on Aug 2023.

# My research interest
I'm interested in Natural Language Processing. I believe that the recent progress in LLMs (Large Language Models) is way different from what we'd expect of an [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). The most exciting treasures of NLP and AI are still waiting for us to discover.

> I'm a huge fan of [FC Bayern Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich) (Man's football), [Golden State Warriors](https://www.nba.com/warriors/) (Man's basketball), and [Team Vitality](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Vitality) (LoL Esports).
